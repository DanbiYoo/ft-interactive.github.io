Github Desktop is a GUI app that can do the basic git actions like committing and branching, as well as providing a good visual overview of the state of your project. It's not restricted to Github-hosted projects, and it doesn't prevent you also using the `git` command (you can jump between the two).

If you want a more comprehensive GUI tool for git, try [SourceTree](sourcetree).

## Installation

```sh
