## Installation

### Mac OS X

<aside>
Note: your Mac might already have `git` installed (you can check using `$ git --version`), but it might be an old copy. It doesn't hurt to install the latest version with `brew`, which will .
</aside>

Use Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install git
```

### Windows

Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and download the Windows build.

## Usage

```md
