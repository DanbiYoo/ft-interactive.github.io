    ### Avoid having to use sudo

    *THIS SECTION NEEDS WRITING*

    ### Upgrade your npm

    The version of `npm` that ships with Node is often out of date. Fortunately, npm is itself just an npm package. So you can use it to update itself:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --global npm
    ```

    ### Check your install

    Check the versions of Node and npm. Hopefully you should have these versions or later.

    ```sh
    $ node --version
    v4.1.2
    ```

    ```sh
    $ npm --version
    v4.1.2
    ```

    ### Install a version manager
    
    Sometimes you have to open an old project that requires an old version of Node, and it's a pain to have to uninstall and reinstall Node just for this purpose.

    A Node version manager lets you have multiple Nodes on your system at once, and switch between them with a simple command.

    There are two popular version managers for Node:

    - [**n**](https://github.com/tj/n)
    - [**nvm**](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

    Use **n** if you're not sure.
