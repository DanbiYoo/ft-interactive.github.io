ST3 is not free software, but it can be used for free indefinitely (if you don't mind it nagging you occasionally). It's technically still in beta, but it's stable enough.

## Install some packages

ST3 has ‘packages’, which add extra functionality (such as syntax highlighting for extra languages it doesn't ship with).

1. [Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
2. Now [use](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage) it to install whatever packages you need.

#### Recommended packages

These packages are good for our projects:

```md
Babel
Emmet
GitGutter
Handlebars
MarkdownEditing
Sass
SublimeLinter
SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint
SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint
```

To install a package, press <kbd>CMD+SHIFT+P</kbd> and start typing "install" (until "Package Control: Install Package" is selected), press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. Wait for the package list to appear, type the one you want, and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> again.


```md
TO COME:
  - curl script to bulk-install the above packages?
```
