  h2#precursor 1. Before you start
  :marked
    You'll need to have a recent XCode on your machine for Homebrew to work.

    1. Install XCode from the App Store. (Takes a while.)
    2. Open XCode once so you can accept the licence agreement. Then close it again.

  h2#install 2. Install Homebrew
  :marked
    Visit [brew.sh](http://brew.sh/) and follow the instructions.

    After installing, your system will now have the `brew` command. This makes it easy to install other tools like [Node.js](/software/node/).

    *TKTKTK should we add stuff about brew doctor here? And do we need to add anything about taking ownership?*

  h2#cask 3. Install Homebrew Cask
  :marked
    This is a useful extension to Homebrew. While the `brew` command is generally for installing command line tools, `brew cask` is for installing Mac apps like Chrome, Sublime Text 3, etc. This is often much easier than manually downloading and installing apps from their websites or from the App Store.

    To install:
    
    ```sh
    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    ```

    

    Now you can install Mac apps with a simple command, like this:

    ```sh
    $ brew cask install sublime-text3
    ```

    The apps are kept in a central location managed by Cask, and then symlinked from your `~/Applications` folder.
