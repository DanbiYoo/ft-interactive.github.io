## Installation

Use Homebrew Cask:

```sh
$ brew cask install iterm2
```

Alternatively, go to [iterm2.com](https://www.iterm2.com/) and install it manually.

## Recommended settings

It's usually helpful if it remembers your current location when you're in a new tab. To do this:

1. Open iTerm's Preferences
2. Click Profiles
3. In the General tab, under Working Directory, select "Reuse previous session's directory"
