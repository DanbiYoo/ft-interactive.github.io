      ## Setting up a new project

      Make sure you're in an empty directory, then run the quickstart script:

      ```sh
      $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ft-interactive/psk-quickstart/master/quickstart.bundled.js | node
      ```

      You now have a new project based on the starter kit.

      You can see what the quickstart script does [here](https://github.com/ft-interactive/psk-quickstart/blob/master/quickstart.js).

      ## Using it

      ### Developing

      Start the development server like this:

      ```sh
      $ npm start
      ```

      The command output should tell you what URL the dev server is running on â€“ open it in your browser. (If you're using [iTerm](../software/iterm-2), you can <kbd>CMD+click</kbd> on the URL and it should open in your browser.)

      While the dev server is running, you can edit files within `client` and your browser should refresh automatically.

      For help with common tasks like using d3 or adding o-header, use the [recipes](https://github.com/ft-interactive/project-starter-kit/tree/master/docs/recipes) in the repo.


      ### Building for production

      Run this command to do a full production build:

      ```sh
      $ npm run build
      ```

      That will build a deployable copy of your app to the `dist` directory.

      ### Deploying
