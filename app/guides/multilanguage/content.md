# Multilanguage projects

Some projects are made in both English and Chinese versions.

To help Google and other bots work out which version to show to users, each version should have a special `link` tag in the `head`.

## Examples

English page linking to the Chinese version:

```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="zh-cn" href="http://www.ftchinese.com/LINK/TO/CHINESE/VERSION">
```

Chinese page linking to the English version:

```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://ig.ft.com/LINK/TO/ENGLISH/VERSION">`
```
