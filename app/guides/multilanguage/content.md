# Multilanguage projects

Some of our projects are available in both English and Chinese versions.

To help Google and other bots decide which version to show to users, each version should have a special `link` tag in the `head`.

## Examples

English page linking to the Chinese version:

```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="zh-cn" href="http://www.ftchinese.com/LINK/TO/CHINESE/VERSION">
```

Chinese page linking to the English version:

```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://ig.ft.com/LINK/TO/ENGLISH/VERSION">`
```
