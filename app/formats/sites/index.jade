      These are simple static web apps hosted on our own development server. They are 'static' in the sense they are simple files served by Apache â€“ but they often load data from an external service like Bertha and then render it using something like D3.

      Static sites are often started using our [boilerplate](#) and typically use some a few Origami components like o-header and o-footer.

      They should always be responsive.
