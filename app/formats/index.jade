  p.o-techdocs-leadbody We have a few ways of getting things on the web.

  //---------------------------------------------
  h2#sites Static sites/pages
  :markdown
    These are simple static web apps hosted on our own development server. They are 'static' in the sense they are simple files served by Apache â€“ but they often load data from an external service like Bertha and then render it using something like D3.

    They are often started using our [boilerplate](#) and typically use some a few Origami components like o-header and o-footer.

    They should generally be responsive.

  h2#wrapper-page Falcon wrapper pages

  p Wrapper pages are good for when we want to make a normal-looking (Falcon-style) FT page, with standard FT navigation, but with not much else going on on the page. This gives us a lot of control so we can do layout/scroll-related things like sticky in-page navigation. (However, we're still limited by the unresponsive Falcon design.)

  h3#wrapper-page-examples Examples
  :markdown
    The vast majority of our wrapper pages have been used for timeline stories. These have a 'sticky timeline' component that reacts to page scrolling.

    With a right rail:
    - [Mark Carney Timeline](http://ig.ft.com/sites/2014/carney-timeline/) (uses [this wrapper](http://www.ft.com/thirdpartywrapper/carneytimeline))
    - [The battle for Simandou](http://ig.ft.com/sites/2014/guinea-timeline/) (uses [this wrapper](http://www.ft.com/thirdpartywrapper/simandou))

    Full width:
    - [Countdown to Paris](http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/paris-climate-timeline/) (uses [this wrapper](http://www.ft.com/thirdpartywrapper/worldeurope))
    - [Crisis in Ukraine](http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/ukraine-timeline/) (uses the same wrapper as the Paris one)

  h3#wrapper-page-how-to How to do one
  :markdown
    1. Get a wrapper set up by Mus, or choose one that already exists (see below). You can always use an existing one during development and switch it later.
    2. Set up something on the server that will download your wrapper page and dynamically inject your own content into it. You probably want your main content to go in `.editorialSection .freestyle[data-comp-index=0]`. You may also want to inject scripts/styles into the wrapper's `<head>`.

  h4#wrapper-page-php ...using a PHP script
  :markdown
    Example `index.php`:

        <?php
        require 'CENSORED/wrapper-page-injector.php'; // check an example timeline on the server for the real path

        print injectContentIntoWrapper(
          file_get_contents('content.html'),
          'http://www.ft.com/thirdpartywrapper/worldeurope'
        );

    - `content.html` is your own web application (without any FT header/nav/footer etc).
    - The `injectContentIntoWrapper` will load the given wrapper URL. Then it will select key pieces of your content page, and copy them over to the correct locations in the wrapper page HTML:
      - it copies the `<title>` from the content page to the wrapper page
      - it takes any scripts and stylesheets in the content page's `<head>` and injects them into the wrapper page's `<head>`
      - it takes the entire inner HTML of `<body>` from the content page, and injects it into `.editorialSection .freestyle[data-comp-index=0]` in the wrapper page.

    Although some of these seem to be named for a particular story, you may reuse them if they appear to be set up how you would want them.

    Some have a right-rail (so your content has to fit in 600px), others have a full-width space (972px).
