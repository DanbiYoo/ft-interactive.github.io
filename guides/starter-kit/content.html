<h2>What is the Starter Kit?</h2><p>It&#39;s a bunch of files you can use as a template for a new project. These files are held in a <a href="https://github.com/ft-interactive/starter-kit">repository on Github</a>. It&#39;s similar to Google&#39;s Web Starter Kit, but less generic and more FT.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s included?</h2><ul>
<li>A build system, so you can run tasks to process and optimise your code. This build system includes:<ul>
<li>Sass – a language that compiles to CSS. It looks similar to CSS but has extra functionality.</li>
<li>Babel – converts ES2015 JavaScript to the more widely-supported ES5, so you can use <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/">next-generation JavaScript features</a> today while still supporting older browsers.</li>
<li>Code minification and other optimisations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <code>index.html</code> with all our usual boilerplate (header, footer, analytics code, social media meta tags.).</li>
<li>Some basic Sass and JavaScript files to start you off.</li>
<li>Various configuration files for things like Origami and Bower.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to start a new project</h2><h3>The quick way (Mac-only, for now)</h3><p>If you haven&#39;t already got it, install <a href="https://github.com/callumlocke/startfrom"><strong>startfrom</strong></a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm install -g startfrom
</code></pre>
<p>Then make sure you&#39;re in an empty directory, and run this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ startfrom ft-interactive/starter-kit
</code></pre>
<p>If it finishes with the message &quot;ALL DONE!&quot;, you should be good to go.</p>
<h3>The manual way (works on any platform)</h3><p>Just do what the <a href="https://github.com/ft-interactive/psk-quickstart/blob/master/quickstart.js">quickstart script</a> does, which is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ft-interactive/starter-kit/archive/master.zip">Download a zip</a> of the Starter Kit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extract the zip. You should have a folder containing a bunch of files (such as <kbd>gulpfile.babel.js</kbd>). Rename the folder to something appropriate for your project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete stuff you don&#39;t need: the <kbd>docs</kbd> folder and the <kbd>README.md</kbd>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initialize it as a git repo (<kbd>git init</kbd>, or use SourceTree or something) and do an initial commit of all the files in the starter kit (e.g. <kbd>git add .</kbd> and <kbd>git commit -m &quot;starter-kit&quot;</kbd> – or use your preferred GUI tool instead). This step is a good idea because it means you will always be able to compare with this first commit to quickly see which code <em>you&#39;ve</em> written as opposed to what came with the starter kit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><kbd>cd</kbd> into your new project, and run <kbd>npm install</kbd>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If that all finishes without errors, you&#39;re good to go.</p>
<h2>Developing your app</h2><p>Start the development server like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm start
</code></pre>
<p>The command output should tell you where your dev server is running (the <kbd>Local</kbd> URL) – open this in your browser. (Tip: if you&#39;re using <a href="../software/iterm-2">iTerm</a>, you can simply <kbd>CMD+click</kbd> on the URL and it should open in your browser.)</p>
<p>While the dev server is running, you can edit files within <kbd>client</kbd> and your browser should refresh automatically.</p>
<p>The automatic refreshing is done by <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a>, which also magically syncs up scrolling and other events between multiple devices, making it easier to develop with a bunch of phones and tablets on your desk.</p>
<p>Remember to commit often – see the <a href="../git-workflow/">git workflow</a> guide.</p>
<h2>Building for production</h2><p>Run this command to do a full production build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>That will build a deployable copy of your app to the <code>dist</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Deploying to the IG web server</h2><p>There&#39;s a deploy task that lets you easily upload the contents of your <code>dist</code> folder to the <a href="../../resources/ig-web-server/">IG web server</a>.</p>
<h3>First-time preparation</h3><p>Before you deploy for the first time, you&#39;ll need to set your deploy target:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>gulpfile.babel.js</code> and find the line <code>const deployTarget = &#39;&#39;;</code></li>
<li>Set the value to an appropriate location for your project, such as <code>&#39;features/henry-rollins-profile&#39;</code>.<ul>
<li>This is the location (relative to the public web root) where your project will be uploaded.</li>
<li>Think of it as the <code>XXX</code> in <code>https://ig.ft.com/XXX/</code></li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> include a leading or trailing slash.</li>
<li>See <a href="../naming-conventions">Naming conventions</a> for advice on picking a good project name, and for formatting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Deploying</h3><pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm run deploy
</code></pre>
<aside>
<p>Remember: you&#39;ll generally want to <strong>build</strong> before you deploy. If you want to do both in one line:</p>
<p><kbd>npm run build &amp;&amp; npm run deploy</kbd></p>
