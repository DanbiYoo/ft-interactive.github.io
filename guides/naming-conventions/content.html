<h1>Naming conventions</h1><h2>Format for filenames and directory names</h2><p>Basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>All lowercase.</li>
<li>Use hyphens to separate words (not camelCase, and no_underscores_please)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t include dates or any technical metadata unless you have a very good reason.</li>
<li>Just name it what it is, being clear and precise (<code>david-cameron.jpg</code> is beter than <code>photo.jpg</code>).</li>
<li>Avoid abbreviating things too much. Filenames don&#39;t need to be short.</li>
<li>Never put things like <code>-new</code> or <code>-fixed</code> or <code>-FINAL</code> in a filename. Instead, just replace the old file, keeping the name the same, and track the change with git â€“ this is usually better than having multiple versions of a file knocking about. If you <em>really</em> need to version a filename, just append it with a number (e.g. <code>cat-2</code>), then at least you can increment the number later if necessary.</li>
</ul>
