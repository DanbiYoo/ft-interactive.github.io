<h1>Linting</h1><p class="o-techdocs-leadbody">Linters are tools that help to improve the quality of your code by alerting you to possible problems.</p>

<p>Even if code <em>works</em> in the browser, it can still have problems that will cause headaches later – it might have inconsistent indentation, or it might use &#39;bad&#39; parts of the language such as the <code>==</code> operator in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Linters automatically alert you to sloppy code so you can clean it up.</p>
<p>We use the same linters that Origami uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> for JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint">scss-lint</a> for Sass</li>
</ul>
<aside>
<p>NB. Older projects used JSHint instead of ESLint.</p>

<h2>Inline lint highlighting in your editor</h2><p>We recommend setting up your editor so it shows you lint errors while you work. This can take a bit of getting used to, but it can help you to write much cleaner code.</p>

<h3>Recommended packages</h3><p>Install one of these combinations of packages to get inline lint highlighting working in your editor.</p>
<p><strong>For Atom:</strong> <a href="https://atom.io/packages/linter">linter</a> + <a href="https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint">linter-eslint</a> + <a href="https://atom.io/packages/linter-scss-lint">linter-scss-lint</a></p>
<p><strong>For Sublime Text 3:</strong> <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter">SublimeLinter</a> + <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint">SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint</a> + <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint">SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint</a></p>
<h2>Blocking your build if there are lint errors</h2><p>Linters should be seen as ‘helpful information’ while you&#39;re developing, and an ‘enforcement tool’ when you&#39;re building for production or committing code.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t</strong> let lint errors prevent you doing a development build of your code. This would make it unrealistically hard to do your job. For example, adding a <code>debugger;</code> statement to your code is a lint error (because you&#39;d never want that statement to appear in production), but you wouldn&#39;t want this lint error to block you from doing a development build, otherwise there would be no point in using the statement at all. As long as you <em>know</em> when you have lint errors in your code (e.g. by having them highlighted in your editor, or seeing them appear in your terminal while you&#39;re working), and as long as you clean them up before committing, it&#39;s OK for them to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do</strong> set up your build sequence so production builds will fail if there are lint errors. (If you really need to quickly do a production build to fix a live emergency, and lint errors are just getting in the way, then of course it&#39;s OK to temporarily disable linting.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Projects started with the <a href="../project-starter-kit/">starter kit</a></strong> already follow the above advice – the development server (<code>npm start</code>) tells you about lint errors in your console while you&#39;re working, but these errors don&#39;t block things building; the build script (<code>npm run build</code>) on the other hand will refuse to continue if there are lint errors.</p>
