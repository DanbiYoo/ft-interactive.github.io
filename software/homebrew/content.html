<p>There are a few steps to setting this up, but it&#39;s worth it â€“ Homebrew makes installing other tools much easier.</p>
<h2>Setting up Homebrew</h2><h3>1. Before you start</h3><p>You&#39;ll need to have a recent XCode on your machine for Homebrew to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install or upgrade XCode using the Mac App Store (<a href="macappstores://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835">direct link</a>). This might take a while.</li>
<li>Open XCode, accept the licence agreement, then quit XCode.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Install Homebrew</h3><p>Go to <a href="http://brew.sh/">brew.sh</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>3. Install Homebrew Cask</h3><p>While <code>brew</code> is generally for installing command line tools, <code>brew cask</code> is for installing regular Mac apps like Firefox and Slack.</p>
<p>To install Cask:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
</code></pre>
