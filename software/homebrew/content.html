<p>There are a few steps to setting this up, but it&#39;s worth it. Once you have Homebrew, installing other stuff is much easier.</p>
<h2>Setting up Homebrew</h2><h3>1. Before you start</h3><p>You&#39;ll need to have a recent XCode on your machine for Homebrew to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install or upgrade XCode using the Mac App Store (<a href="macappstores://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835">direct link</a>). This might take a while.</li>
<li>Open XCode, accept the licence agreement, then quit XCode.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, take ownership of the <code>/usr/local</code> directory (inside which Homebrew needs full access) with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Install Homebrew</h3><ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://brew.sh/">brew.sh</a> and follow the instructions to install it.</li>
<li>Run <code>brew doctor</code> to diagnose any potential problems with how your system is set up. Try to follow its instructions to fix any problems. (Ask for help if needed.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Install Homebrew Cask</h3><p>While <code>brew</code> is generally for installing command line tools, <code>brew cask</code> is for installing regular Mac apps like Firefox and Slack.</p>
<p>To install Cask:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>What does Homebrew Cask do?</h4><p>It will allow you to install <a href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/tree/master/Casks">lots of Mac apps</a> from the command line, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ brew cask install firefox
</code></pre>

<h2>Using Homebrew</h2><p>The main things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it&#39;s a good idea to run <code>brew update</code> before running <code>brew install XXXXX</code>. This downloads any recent formula changes from Homebrew (and these changes are happening all the time).</p>
</li>
<li><p>running <code>brew doctor</code> can help diagnose issues with your system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme">Homebrew repo</a> has lots more documentation.</p>
