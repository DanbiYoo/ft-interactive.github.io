<p>Github Desktop is a GUI app that can do the basic git actions like committing and branching, as well as providing a good visual overview of the state of your project. It&#39;s not restricted to Github-hosted projects, and it doesn&#39;t prevent you also using the <code>git</code> command (you can jump between the two).</p>
