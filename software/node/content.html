<h2>Installation</h2><h3>Mac OS X</h3><p>Using Homebrew:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ brew install node
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> and install it manually.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3><p>Go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> and install it manually.</p>
<h2>Checking your installation</h2><p>You should now have two new commands available, <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code>. Try them out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ node --version
v5.0.0
$ npm --version
3.3.12
</code></pre>
<p>(It&#39;s OK if your version numbers are higher.)</p>
<h2>Upgrading from an old version</h2><p>You can simply install the latest version over your old one. Better still, install a version manager (see below) so you can switch between different versions easily.</p>
<h2>Upgrading npm</h2><p>npm is the package manager for Node. It comes bundled with Node itself, but you might sometimes want to upgrade to a newer version if one is available. Because npm is itself an npm package, it can upgrade itself like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --global npm
</code></pre>
<p>After that, <code>npm --version</code> should show that you&#39;re on the latest available version.</p>
<h2>ðŸŽ± Bonus steps (for an optimal Node set-up)</h2><p>These extra steps are not essential, but are recommended.</p>
<h3>Relocate your global packages to your home directory</h3><p>Follow <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md">these steps</a> to relocate your global <code>node_modules</code> directory so it&#39;s under your home directory.</p>
<p>Doing this means you&#39;ll be able to install global modules without <code>sudo</code>, which is easier and safer.</p>
<h3>Install a version manager</h3><p>Sometimes you have to open an old project that requires an old version of Node, and it&#39;s a pain to have to uninstall and reinstall Node just for this.</p>
<p>A <strong>version manager</strong> solves this problem: it lets you easily switch between Node versions with a simple command. It also makes it easier to get the latest Node when they release a new version.</p>
<p>There are two popular version managers available: <a href="https://github.com/tj/n"><strong>n</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm"><strong>nvm</strong></a>.</p>
<p>To install <strong>n</strong> (recommended):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install --global n
</code></pre>
<p>Now try switching to a different Node version (try <code>node --version</code> after each one, to verify that the version actually changed):</p>
<ul>
<li>type <code>n 0.12</code> to switch to version 0.12</li>
<li>type <code>n 4.2</code> to switch to version 4.2</li>
<li>type <code>n stable</code> to switch to the latest stable version (this is the one you should generally stick to)</li>
</ul>
<aside>
<h5>Notes on using <strong>n</strong></h5>

<ul>
<li>The first time you ask to switch to a particular Node version, it will take a couple of minutes, as <strong>n</strong> needs to download and install that version.
<li>When you switch Node version, your npm version will often change with it.
</ul>
