## Quick start

1. Clone this repository and run `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`
3. Open the URL (from the command output) in your browser.

You can then edit files within `./app` while the dev server is running.

#### Use BrowserSync

You can proxy the dev server through BrowserSync for automatic page reloads.

To install: `npm install -g browser-sync`

Just run the site as usual using `npm start`, then run the following command in a separate terminal tab:

```sh
$ browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:9000" --files "app/**/*"
```

Then open the local URL that BrowserSync prints out (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

See BrowserSync's [CLI options](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/command-line/#command-line-options) (and more details on the general [options page](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/)).


## Deploying

It's automatic: just edit code and push to the default branch, **production**.

Better still, do your work in a different branch and open a pull request â€“ then, once Travis has reported that your changes are OK, merge it into production.

How it works: Whenever new code is pushed to the production branch, Travis will build it, commit the built `dist` to master, and push this back to Github. (The master branch is what Github serves as the public website.)

Problems? Check the logs on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/ft-interactive/ft-interactive.github.io).

Note that Github Pages can be slow to update. But as long as you can see your changes in the [master branch](https://github.com/ft-interactive/ft-interactive.github.io/tree/master), they should appear eventually.


## Debugging the live site

If everything works locally, but there are problems with the deployed website:

1. Do a production build: `npm run build` (this should create a `dist` directory, and should complete without error).
2. Serve up the `dist` directory using [srvlr](https://github.com/kavanagh/srvlr) or something similar.
3. Debug away.
